					<h3>May 29th 2020 - June 18th, 2020</h3>
					<p>
						My first Let's Play. This let's play was very much not in my current format as this entire LP was streamed on Twitch. 
						Before the LP, I had played probably about half of the game myself, but I had seen the whole game through multiple times 
						and knew the game quite thoroughly despite not having beaten it myself. The logo above hadn't been used during the LP, simply
						because I hadn't started making logos for let's plays yet (this was made significantly later).

					<h3>June 19th, 2020 - June 9th, 2023</h3>
					<p>
						This LP will forever stick out in my mind. You may notice that it took me almost three full years to finish this relatively short 
						game. This game was the first of four games that began before I started making videos consistently. This started back in my 
						streaming era along with another game. Both of these games had been played on an emulator (if you don't know what an emulator is, 
						google it because it will take too long to explain here.) and the saves for said emulator got wiped after I needed to reset my 
						computer. I later came back to this game and the other when I finally had a legitimate way to play them (this also meant replaying 
						to where I was in the LP).

					<h3>June 20th, 2020 - July 7th, 2023</h3>
					<p>
						This was the other game that I had lost my save on after resetting my computer. This one took a bit longer to get a legitimate 
						way to play the game, but I did eventually get a way to play it. This game has a similar history with me as EarthBound has. I 
						had played somewhere from 25-50% of the game in my own time and eventually decided to LP it. I definitely prefer EarthBound over 
						this game, but I do still recommend any RPG fans to check this one out.

					<h3>July 10th, 2020 - </h3>
					<p>
						Despite this LP not being finished, I'm putting in this list anyway. This LP began after my streaming era, but was still when 
						I was using emulators for my LPs (I do still use them if I need to) and so this game's save was caught in the Great Wipe (yes 
						I gave it a name). I have since obtained an actual copy of the game and do intend to return to it (sometime post GTA 5).

					<h3>April 26th, 2021 - April 21st, 2023</h3>
					<p>
						This was my first LP that wasn't done in a emulator. I had obtained what is now a ridiculously complicated setup for capturing 
						console games. This LP sadly doesn't look all that good simply because this is a Wii game and so it was upscaled to be 1080p 
						and so it looks bad. This was the first time that I had completely 100%ed the game, but i had gotten the main 120 stars in my 
						own time at least once. I am still far more familiar with Galaxy 2 since I grew up with that game, but I still had a ton of fun 
						finally 100%ing this game.

						<br>
						(GCN/Wii/Wii U/NS)

					<h3>Feb. 20th, 2023 - March 20th, 2023</h3>
					<p>
						My first start-to-finish LP after I started making videos again. I had played maybe 20 minutes of this game before I went to 
						prepare for the LP. I had seen the entire game, but basically hadn't played it. I played through the game 100% probably a couple 
						of weeks before I recorded the LP so I would actually know what I was doing when I did the LP. This was played in an emulator (with
						a lot of caution) because some Gamecube/Wii games are a bit too expensive for me to reasonably obtain. This game is much easier to 
						obtain now that it's released on Switch, so if you enjoy Real Time Strategy games, I highly recommend.

						Let's Play #7: Super Metroid
						<br>
						(SNES/Wii/Wii U/New 3DS/NS)
					</h2>
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpN_E--or1v9CuVjXYfFyXNrxDNI3bOij"><img class="lp" src="images/yt-logos/metroid3.jpg"></a>
					<h3>April 24th, 2023 - May 5th, 2023</h3>
					<p>
						My shortest LP to date, but one that I have an interesting history with. Before the LP, I had 100%ed Super Metroid probably around 
						10 or so times, but only maybe 2 of them being beating the game normally. Every other time I've beaten this game, it was as a 
						randomizer (a randomizer is where you take all the items in a game and shuffle where they are). Because I was so used to not 
						being able to play the game normally, this LP was honestly kinda weird. If you like Metroidvania's, play this game, it spawned 
						the term Metroidvania.
